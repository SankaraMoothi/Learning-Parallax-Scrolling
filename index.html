        parallax, in astronomy, the difference in direction of a celestial
        object as seen by an observer from two widely separated points. The
        measurement of parallax is used directly to find the distance of the
        body from Earth (geocentric parallax) and from the Sun (heliocentric
        parallax). The two positions of the observer and the position of the
        object form a triangle; if the base line between the two observing
        points is known and the direction of the object as seen from each has
        been measured, the apex angle (the parallax) and the distance of the
        object from the observer can be found simply. In the determination of a
        celestial distance by parallax measurement, the base line is taken as
        long as possible in order to obtain the greatest precision of
        measurement. For the Sun and Moon, the base line used is the distance
        between two widely separated points on Earth; for all bodies outside the
        solar system, the base line is the axis of Earth’s orbit. The largest
        measured stellar parallax is 0.75″, for the nearest star, Alpha
        Centauri; the smallest that can be directly measured is about 25 times
        smaller, but indirect methods discussed below permit calculation of the
        parallax, inversely proportional to the distance, for more and more
        distant objects but also with more and more uncertainty. <br />
